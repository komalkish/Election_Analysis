## Election Audit Summary
Python supports several programming paradigms: object-oriented programming, procedural programming, and functional programming. The object-oriented paradigm of Python is great for solving complex software development challenges. As one more benefit of Python, It allows developers to follow the Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY) concept and SOLID principles in programming. The object-oriented programming approach also encourages modality of code that makes life easier for programmers with simpler troubleshooting, streamlined problem solving, and the possibility to reuse code. These are just a few of the additional benefits of choosing Python to analyze election audit results.
